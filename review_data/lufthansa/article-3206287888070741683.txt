"They lost 2 baggage of mine"
Z Vidakovics (United States) 28th August 2022
Not Verified | Flew from LAX to Budapest via Frankfurt on 8/26, The Frankfurt flight number was LH1340. Our boarding in Frankfurt was delayed with an hour, then we had to wait another 1.5 hours on the plane because of refueling and waiting for the baggage to be loaded. After a total of 2.5 hours of wait we finally took off. Came to find out at the baggage claim in Budapest that they never loaded luggage on the plane. The local agent said that Lufthansa called them hours earlier that no checked-in luggage will be on this flight, and that they already informed the passengers, which of course never happened. They lost 2 baggage of mine. I immediately filed a report online, but now after 24 hours there's still no significant update. The local handling agent, doesn't pick up the phone. This experience will ruin this long awaited vacation. Lufthansa is terrible, stay away them if possible.
