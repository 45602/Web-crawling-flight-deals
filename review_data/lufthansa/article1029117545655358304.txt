"Our seats were changed at boarding"
T Carowiec (Germany) 27th August 2022
âœ… Trip Verified | The flights were delayed and overbooked. Our seats were changed at boarding without notice so I was separated from my family. The voucher which was supposed compensation for earlier rebooking did not work.
