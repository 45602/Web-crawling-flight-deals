"disorganized and terrible experience"
N Gan (United States) 27th August 2022
✅ Trip Verified | Extremely disorganized and terrible experience. They lost my luggage for over 48 hours and local luggage tracking number would not answer the phone while global customer luggage tracking service had no idea whether my bag was in Germany and Singapore. I had no clothing for my business trip and the only “compensation” they could provide a toiletries bag.
