"Worst experience ever"
L Sonny (United States) 27th August 2022
Not Verified | Last night we arrived to Budapest via LH1340 and found out that our luggage are missing. We have been status of our baggage and still showing nothing. The flight was supposed to leave Frankfurt yesterday 4:15 and was delayed and departed 6:33pm, while waiting they kept on telling us the delay is due to runway delay, then our baggage are being loaded, etc. We have been to Europe a couple of times, this is the first time we used Lufthansa , and definitely this will be the last. Worst experience ever, staff are rude. Flight from lax to Frankfurt is 11hrs something and they served us small very sour pasta with a couple of cold breads, then on breakfast just 1 weird tasting sandwich. 2nd day, still no status on our luggage, they are answering phone and replying to our email.
