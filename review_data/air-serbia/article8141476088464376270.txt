âœ… Trip Verified | Their plane from Sochi to Belgrade was delayed (JU679 of Aug 8th, 2022) I couldn't catch a connection to Bologna because it was already gone (JU550 of Aug 8th, 2022) I was given another itinerary by their representative in Belgrade through Split and Vienna Their plane (JU252) to Split was delayed, I couldn't catch my connection to Vienna and then to Bologna I was left with no assistance at the Split airport, I tried to contact them by phone but nobody answered The day after I took a bus to Bologna at my own expense, not to mention that I had to sleep in the open air and I had to buy food for that day. I asked for a refund right away filling in all of their forms and after several days a machine is telling me that it will take time to peruse my request.
