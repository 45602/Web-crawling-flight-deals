âœ… Trip Verified | Airplane was delayed for 4 hours, but first two hours nobody would announce anything and give some info why and for how long plane will be delayed. Then finally after more waiting we sat on the plane, while driving to the runway the pilot suddenly said there was an engine issue and we have to go back. We were sitting in 36 C degrees on the plane when finally they said we can go to the bus and sit with a/c. Plane was small and announcement was very loud (I am kind of deaf - but it was too loud for me). Crew were more making a joke about the situation than really trying to help and inform passengers. A plus was that they gave us a snack but everybody got different. I think some got aa toasted sandwich, but some got a small bottle of water, some candy etc. Apparently whatever was left from the previous flight.

 3/10
