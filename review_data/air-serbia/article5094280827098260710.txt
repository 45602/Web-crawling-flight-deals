âœ… Trip Verified | When we were leaving Serbia they delayed our flight. I asked information desk and they said they had no information about the flight. I asked a person at the gate and she told me the plane was here and there were no issues. So after waiting we asked information and they said the plane was in the air and expected to arrive soon. So after waiting some more we asked information again and they said the plane was stuck in Turkey because of bad weather. I checked the weather radar in Turkey and there was no cloud over Turkey. The customers were getting irritated and the information lady said if anyone else asked that she would call the cops on everyone in line. Customer service does not exist in Air Serbia.
